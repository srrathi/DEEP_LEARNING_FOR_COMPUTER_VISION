I'm a first-year Electrical Engineering student in the prestigious college of National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, INDIA(http://nith.ac.in/).

I'm interested in many things such as music, reading novels, watching movies, photography. I love to read suspense thrillers.

A curious and hard-working person who always want to create new-new things to make our life simpler and easy.

Presently, I work as a Volunteer in Robotics Society NITH. As a volunteer, I have acquired a lot of skills like C, C++ and Python 3. 

Also, I know some software like Photoshop, After-Effects, Arduino.

Currently, my projects are:

A Quadruped Bot which has 4 legs and each leg has 3 degrees of freedom which in total gives our bot 12 degrees of freedom. Also, it is voice-controlled,

and also it detects objects and follows them. Also, I am working on a line follower bot, which besides detects obstacles around it and tries to avoid it.

A mazer solver, which firstly explores the whole maze and try to find out the shortest path of it. 

I have also made a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python 3.
